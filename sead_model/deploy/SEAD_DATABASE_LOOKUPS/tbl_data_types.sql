7	5	Spot test interpretation	2012-09-21 16:51:47.967181+00	The relative intensity of a spot test result on a three grade scale: 1, 2, 3 where 3 is the highest.
8	1	Continuous	2012-09-21 16:51:47.967181+00	A measured quantity.
9	2	MNI	2012-09-21 16:51:47.967181+00	Minimum Number of Individual organisms as calculated from recorded parts (e.g. whole insect equivalents)
10	7	Partial abundance	2012-09-21 16:51:47.967181+00	A legacy data type used in BugsCEP to represent partially quantified and incomplete lists, e.g. quantified up to 50 individuals and then estimated.
13	7	Undefined other	2012-09-21 16:51:47.967181+00	Data type is not clearly defined, could be a combination of quantification, presence/absence and semi-quantification or qualification. Beware of using data of this type for quantification.
5	2	Abundance	2012-09-21 16:51:47.967181+00	The absolute number of the counted element (e.g. seeds, fossils) present in the sample.
14	8	Uncalibrated dates	2013-09-30 07:53:07.737053+00	Sample ages in uncalibrated values consisting of mean and error (+/-). Requires calibration to compare with calendar years.
15	8	Counted dates	2013-09-30 07:53:52.914425+00	Sample ages derived from counted rings, layers or dated events.
18	7	Categorical & Scaled (0-5	2017-05-17 11:23:57.600695+00	Mix of data specified on a scale of 0 to 5 where 0 is absence and 5 is maximum amount of property, and data classified on the presence of a property (e.g. Granite = tempering by granite present)
19	3	Categorical	2017-05-17 11:27:13.612876+00	Data classified according to a set of predefined categories (e.g. temperature classes; tempering material classes)
6	4	Presence	2012-09-21 16:51:47.967181+00	The element/fossil is present in the sample, but not quantified (numerical classification where 1 = presence)
20	5	Percentage	2017-05-17 11:28:56.394909+00	Data expressed as a percentage (i.e. out x of 100)
