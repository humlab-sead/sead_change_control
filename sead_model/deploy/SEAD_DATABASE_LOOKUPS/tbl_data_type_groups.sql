4	Presence only	2012-09-21 16:51:47.967181+00	Only the existence of taxa/variables in a sample is recorded, as a '1', with no quantity being given. Absence is implicit.
2	Discrete	2012-09-21 16:51:47.967181+00	Systems based on distinct and separate integer values (1,2,3...) from a numerical sequence. This is the standard group for biological proxy counts.
1	Continuous	2012-09-21 16:51:47.967181+00	Systems based on the assumption that data can assume any numerical value.
3	Classification	2012-09-21 16:51:47.967181+00	Any systems based on the division of, or estimation of, quantities into predefined categories, either numerical or relative (e.g. 1-10, few, many). In statistical terms, this group covers ordinal, nominal and categorical data types.
7	Composite scale	2012-09-21 16:51:47.967181+00	Any system which combines two or more forms of counting. E.g. a discrete abundance for small counts and an approximation for super abundant taxa
5	Relative scale	2012-09-21 16:51:47.967181+00	A loose form of classification, where the scale indicates the relative amounts of taxa/variables (1,2,3, many). To be avoided if possible.
8	Chronological	2013-09-30 07:44:47.001056+00	Data which indicate the age of sample, either in relation to an event, decay based curve or counted scale.
