O horizons are not saturated with water for prolonged periods. The mineral fraction of such material is only a small percentage of the volume of the material and generally is much less than half of the weight.
An O layer may be at the surface of a mineral soil or at any depth beneath the surface if it is buried. An horizon formed by illuviation of organic material into a mineral subsoil is not an O horizon, though some horizons formed in this manner contain much organic matter.' where horizon_id = 10;

    - an accumulation of humified organic matter intimately mixed with the mineral fraction and not displaying properties characteristic of E or B horizons (see below);
    - properties resulting from cultivation, pasturing, or similar kinds of disturbance; or
    - a morphology which is different from the underlying B or C horizon, resulting from processes related to the surface.' where horizon_id = 11;

    - illuvial concentration, alone or in combination, of silicate clay, iron, aluminum, humus, carbonates, gypsum or silica;
    - evidence of removal of carbonates;
    - residual concentration of sesquioxides;
    - coatings of sesquioxides that make the horizon conspicuously lower in value, higher in chrome, or redder in hue than overlying and underlying horizons without apparent illuviation of iron;
    - alteration that forms silicate clay or liberates oxides or both and that forms a granular, blocky, or prismatic structure if volume changes accompany changes in moisture content; or
    - brittleness.' where horizon_id = 14;
